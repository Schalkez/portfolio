A sophisticated web application designed to track and visualize interface changes between deployments. This tool captures screenshots of web applications before and after each deployment, allowing developers and stakeholders to easily identify visual regressions and UI improvements.

Built with Next.js for the frontend framework, Firebase for real-time data storage and authentication, and Google Cloud Platform for scalable infrastructure. The application leverages TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching, while Jotai provides lightweight state management for complex UI interactions.

Key features include automated screenshot capture, visual diff comparison, deployment history tracking, and real-time notifications for interface changes. The platform helps teams maintain visual consistency across deployments and quickly identify any unintended UI modifications.
