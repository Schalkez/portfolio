Sale Hunter is a Chrome extension paired with a NestJS backend that automates price
tracking and alerts for e-commerce products. The suite was designed and
implemented with the support of AI coding agents, allowing me to iterate on
system design and implementation far faster than a traditional workflow.

### Key Outcomes

- Replaced the daily manual price-check routine with an automated watchlist and
  notification pipeline.
- Delivered end-to-end architecture (Extension ↔ NestJS ↔ PostgreSQL ↔ Graphile
  Worker) that scales to multiple stores and user watchlists.
- Improved development velocity by delegating boilerplate (CRUD, DTOs,
  migrations) to Cursor while I focused on complex logic and concurrency.

### Technical Highlights

- **Intelligent scraping**: Orchestrated Gemini AI to analyse DOM structures and
  understand a user’s previously selected variants, then generate dynamic
  Playwright flows that reliably extract prices across inconsistent storefronts.
- **Concurrency & resilience**: Used Graphile Worker jobs to fan-out Playwright
  crawlers while maintaining rate limits and tracking historical price changes.
- **Watchlist domain**: Implemented CASL-based authorization so each user only
  sees their own tracked products and alerts.
- **Transactional alerts**: Integrated Brevo to send price drop notifications
  directly from the backend workflow.
