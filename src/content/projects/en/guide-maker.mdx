Guide Maker is a browser extension paired with a Go backend that records user
actions and automatically generates step-by-step guides — screenshots,
descriptions, and HTML exports included. AI coding agents accelerated the design
and implementation, while the core workflow remains deterministic to ensure
predictable documentation output.

### Impact

- Automates documentation capture for product teams, saving the manual effort of
  recording every click.
- Builds a consistent knowledge base with reproducible step-by-step guides.

### Architecture & Highlights

- Designed an end-to-end microservice architecture linking the Chrome extension
  with Go services.
- Used AI-assisted development for boilerplate so I could focus on service
  integration, security (signed URLs, IAM) and deployment architecture.
- Built a video microservice (Cloud Run + FFmpeg) to convert recordings into MP4
  and GIF assets on the fly.
- Implemented rich step management: create/update/delete, drag-to-reorder,
  attach/replace screenshots, and one-click HTML export.
