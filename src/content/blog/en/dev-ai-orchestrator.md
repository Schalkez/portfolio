# 🚀 When a Dev Knows How to Use AI: From Coder to Orchestrator

> "AI doesn’t replace devs. It replaces people who don’t understand what they’re doing."

---

## 😅 A familiar story

You’ve probably seen this (or been this person):

### Scene 1: Thien, the Copy‑Paste King  
> “Hey ChatGPT, make me a login page.”  
→ Gets back 200 lines that run… and one tiny change collapses everything.

### Scene 2: Sang from the Anti‑AI team  
> “AI is dumb, the code is trash.”  
→ While the prompt was literally: “build an e‑commerce website.”

Sounds familiar? AI isn’t dumb — you just haven’t learned how to work with it yet.

## 🎯 Truth: AI is like a super‑fast junior dev team

What it’s great at:
- ⚡ Codes fast  
- 😴 Never needs a break  
- 💸 Doesn’t ask for a raise  

What it needs from you:
- ✅ Clear goals  
- 🔍 Careful review  
- 🧠 Guidance toward the right approach  

That’s exactly how I use AI daily. Here’s the workflow I follow.

## 🧠 Three steps to master AI (without getting dragged around)

### Step 1: Talk to AI as if you’re clarifying requirements with a client

Before coding, I use ChatGPT or Claude to understand the real problem.

Example:
```
You: "I want to build a price‑tracking feature for any product URL."

AI: "Okay, a few questions:
- Personal tracking only, or shared?
- Do you need real‑time alerts?
- Which domains should be supported?
- Scheduled crawling (e.g., every 6h) or on‑demand when users visit?
- Target scale: 100 URLs, 10,000, or 1,000,000?"
```

I let AI ask me back — those 5 minutes usually help me:
- Spot edge cases  
- Choose the right solution  
- Avoid going in the wrong direction  

> Tip: Ask AI “What should I ask before building this feature?”

---

### Step 2: Have AI draft a detailed plan

Once I pick a direction, I say:
```
"Create a detailed task list for the login feature.
Each task must include:
- Clear input/output
- Concrete acceptance criteria
- Required test cases"
```

AI produces something like:
```
✅ Task 1: Design the User database schema  
✅ Task 2: Build the JWT service  
✅ Task 3: Implement the login API endpoint  
...
```

Now I’ve got a clear path — no more “where do I even start?”

---

### Step 3: Code with AI — but you stay in control

This is crucial: never approve or paste code you don’t understand.

When AI writes code, I:

#### Ask back:
```
“Which hashing algorithm fits this checksum use case?”
“This ‘get all products’ query may load thousands of items into RAM — how do we prevent that?”
```

#### Ask for explanations:
```
“Explain this DOM‑parsing function step‑by‑step.”
“Should this be pipelined? Why?”
```

#### Push refactors:
```
“This error‑handling branch is messy — refactor using Lodash and RxJS so it’s easier to read.”
“Extract this small util function; it shouldn’t live inside the service file.”
“The search module isn’t SOLID‑friendly — add TODOs for the refactor steps and I’ll review them.”
```

Result: I learn more, the code is clean, and I fully understand the system flow.

## 📖 Real‑world example: Build an API in 2 hours

Project: Library management API (CRUD + search)

| Time | Work | AI’s role |
|------|------|-----------|
| 15m | Requirement analysis | Brainstorm DB design, API structure, edge cases |
| 10m | Planning | Generate a 12‑task checklist |
| 60m | Coding | AI drafts → I review → Adjust → Test (iterate until done; don’t jump between tasks) |
| 20m | Tests | AI proposes cases → I add edge cases |
| 15m | Docs | AI drafts README → I finalize |

Outcome:  
✅ Full‑featured API with tests and docs  
✅ 100% understanding of the codebase  
⚡ 3–4× faster  
📈 Cleaner and closer to best practices

## 🧭 Mindset shift: From “Coder” to “System designer”

Before (no AI):
- Write every line yourself  
- Drown in repetitive code  
- Google syntax all day  

Now (with AI):
- Focus on system design and architecture  
- Let AI handle repetition  
- You own logic, security, and testing  

> You’re no longer the builder — you’re the architect and supervisor.

## ⚠️ Three things you should never do with AI

❌ Paste code without reading — bugs will come.  
❌ Blindly trust AI — it can hallucinate APIs or suggest outdated patterns.  
❌ Skip tests — AI‑written code without tests is a ticking bomb 💣  

---

## 💪 Skills that still win

AI accelerates you, but it cannot replace:

1. Systems thinking — how everything connects  
2. Debugging — how to find and fix issues  
3. Security mindset — spotting risks  
4. Code review — telling good code from bad  
5. Testing — ensuring stability and safety  

> These require human judgment. AI doesn’t have that.

---

## 🎁 A ready‑to‑use workflow
```text
1. Receive requirement → Ask AI “What should I clarify before starting?”

2. Brainstorm → List 2–3 viable approaches

3. Pick the best → Explain the context back to AI

4. Ask AI to produce a detailed task list

5. Code:
   - AI drafts
   - You review and question
   - Refactor if needed
   - Test thoroughly

6. Have AI propose test cases

7. AI drafts docs → You refine

8. Final review → Commit
```

---

## 🔥 Conclusion

AI doesn’t replace you — it upgrades you.

Winners with AI:
- Solid foundations (code, databases, systems)  
- Ask good questions  
- Learn from AI daily  
- Keep final control  

Losers:
- Copy without understanding  
- Don’t test  
- Refuse to keep learning  

Which side are you on? 😉

## 🚀 Try it today

Next time you code, try this:

1. Don’t Google first  
2. Ask AI: “I’m facing X, help me understand before solving it.”  
3. Let AI ask you back  
4. Choose an approach → Have AI draft → Review carefully  

Trust me — you’ll feel the difference.

P/S: If you found this useful, share it with a teammate. The more devs use AI properly, the stronger our community becomes.
