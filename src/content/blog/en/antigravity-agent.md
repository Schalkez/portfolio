Have you ever imagined a day when AI wouldn't just be an "autocomplete" tool but truly become a teammate (pair programmer) sitting next to you?

Today, I had the chance to experience **<a href="https://antigravity.google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antigravity</a>** - an AI Agent from Google Deepmind, and I'm genuinely impressed by how it works.

## Not Just a Chatbot

Unlike typical chatbots or even coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or Cursor, Antigravity operates with **Agentic** thinking.

What does this mean?

1.  **Autonomy:** Instead of waiting for step-by-step instructions, it can plan independently for large tasks.
2.  **Tool Use:** It can run terminals, read files, edit files, and even install libraries if it detects they're missing (like when it discovered my project was missing `@microsoft/clarity` and automatically ran `pnpm install` to fix it).
3.  **Self-healing:** When it edits the wrong file, it can recognize the mistake, revert it, and find a better approach.

## Human-like Workflow

One thing I really appreciate is how Antigravity communicates. It doesn't just throw code at you.

*   It starts by **exploring the project** to understand the structure.
*   It creates an **Implementation Plan** and asks for approval before making major changes.
*   It **self-verifies** after coding (runs builds, checks for errors).
*   It creates **documentation (Walkthrough)** to summarize what was done.

## Conclusion

Antigravity feels like working with a real Senior Developer rather than a machine. It's proactive, careful, and deeply understands context.

If this is the future of programming, I'm genuinely excited about what comes next!
