# i’m Hiền. i live in Vietnam, where i create things for the web.

i was one of those kids who loved tinkering with computers early on.
instead of playing games, i was more curious about how things worked behind the scenes.
when i was young, i got into programming — not by finishing big projects,
but by getting excited about what could be built.

after school, i studied computer science and have been working as a software developer ever since.
i really love the web because it’s open and instant — anything you build
can be shared with anyone around the world. websites, apis, tools — they’re all just a click away.

in my free time, i like building side projects, exploring new ideas, and mixing design with development.
i’m always curious about new tech and enjoy creating tools that are useful and fun.
if you want to collaborate on something or just have a chat, feel free to
[reach out](#contact).
